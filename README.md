input data format:
==================
"n" - amount of Markov's substitutions in your algorithm
then n lines each in format:
"x-y"     (for normal substitutuion)
or
"x-.y"    (for final substitution)
where "x" and "y" = words
then input word
"w"

==================
output:
====================
program will output the result of your norm algorithm on the word "w"
